# Soccer


## Why I love soccer
I have loved soccer since I was a boy. Ive played it every year since 7th grade. I love soccer becuase it gives me the opportunity to impress, which I enjoy doing. playing on a team is also one of my favorite things to do. I enjoy the company of others who also like soccer. The feeling of winning a game after putting in all the work with your friends/team is a feeling I always enjoy.
